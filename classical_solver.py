# Objects of the class classical_solver, are the ones that can (drumroll)
# solve! It has a tolerance, slopes and so on, useful parameters to predict
# tracks
# Methods in this class can be used in this way:
# E.g., are_compatible is a method that tells if two hits are compatible in
# order to create a track. To call it, we have to have a classical_solver 'c',
# and then we do:
# c.are_compatible(h[0],h[1])
# Obviously, it will be in a for loop or something like that, to know which hits
# are compatible with which ones
